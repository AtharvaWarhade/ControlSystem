# ControlSystem
The EE113_Control_Lecture_Notes.pdf file contains the course notes for the Control systems part of the Introductory Electrical course. They were the basis of the successful functioning of the lab assignment as well as a key to understanding the domain of Controls. 

The Lab_Assignment_Solutions although not mine(I left mine in the institute), has the general idea about the assignment and the concepts used. Most of the solutions my solutions were similar to the ones given in the solution
